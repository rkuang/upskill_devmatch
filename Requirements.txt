Stripe Integration
* Users should have a Stripe customer token in the users table
* JavaScript should prevent Pro form from submitting, when user fills out,
and should send card info to Stripe. Stripe will return with a card token.
* JavaScript should send user fields and card token to our rails app. Rails app
should validate these fields. Rails will note whether plan = 1 or 2.
* Once validated, Rails should send user info (email, planID) and card token to
Stripe server and Stripe will create a subscription and send back customer 
token. Rails should save customer token and user info to our database.
