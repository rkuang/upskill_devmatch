            <p>Hello! My name is Ricky Kuang. I am a Computer Science student at
            UCSB trying to dip my toes into web development for the first time. 
            DevMatch is a fictional startup company I've made with the help of 
            tutorials from upskillcourses.com. It's my first attempt at an 
            application made with Ruby on Rails.</p>
